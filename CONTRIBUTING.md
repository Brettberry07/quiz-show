# Contributing Guide

This project uses a professional style workflow, issues and pull requests will
be closed if not following this format.
<br>**Follow this guide exactly!**

## Workflow Overview

1. Pick an Issue or create one
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make changes
4. Open a Pull Request
5. Wait for review from Cameron or Brett
6. Address review feedback
7. Cameron or Brett will merge when feature meets requirements

## Branch Naming

Use this format only:

`feat:short_description`
`fix:short_description`
`chore:short_description`  

Examples:  
`feat:quiz_timer`  
`fix:login_bug`  
`chore:setup_guide`

Use `feat` for completely new features, `fix` for backwards-compatible changes, and `chore` for non-code or config changes

**Do not commit directly to main branch!**

## Commits

Write clear commit messages  
Good: "Added quiz timer logic and unit tests" <br>
Bad: "Yeah I totally added stuff, this works now"

Commit often. Small commits are better than huge ones.

## Pull Requests

Every PR must:  

1. Reference an Issue  
2. Have a clear description  
3. Pass tests  
4. Be reviewed by a maintainer  

**PRs without descriptions will be closed.**
